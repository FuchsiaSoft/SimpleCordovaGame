# Simple Cordova Game
## Built for National Code Week event held at Leeds Central Library

The working repository for coding tutorial day at Leeds Library

This repo will be gradually built up to form a very simple game that can be used to teach people the basics of HTML and JS.

Every commit in the repo forms a "step" to be completed by the class.
